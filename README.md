### Flexible Infrastructure to support the Design and Delivery of Online Learning {#2}

Trinity Western University in Langley, BC has been behind the curve in offering online learning experiences that engage learners in active, transformative learning. We have been hosting our online courses in a customized installation of Moodle \(1.9\) and have not provided enough support for online course development or online teaching and learning. Beginning in 2016, we renewed our commitment to expanding our online offerings with a specific focus on ensuring that our online courses match the ‘whole person’ engagement and transformation that our campus-based students experience.

Because we are new to the field, we have very few legacy systems and processes in place to constrain the development of a flexible infrastructure to support our course design needs. Given this opportunity, we set forth to create a course design infrastructure based on web-based open source software \(OSS\) that supported a version-controlled, forkable design workflow to produce files in Markdown format for flexible deployment to a front-end user interface.

DeVries \(2013\) noted the similarities between the process of designing courses in the open for open delivery with the process and ethos of the OSS movement and contrasts these two environments with “traditional instructional design”. Similarities between open design of courses and software include having multiple simultaneous versions of the content \(forks or branches\); multiple, diverse end users; and multiple options for front-end delivery. These characteristics are contrasted with traditional instructional design, which typically uses a single official version of a document, predefined end users, and often a single option for content delivery.

We identified very early that we needed a very efficient process in order to meet extremely aggressive timelines with limited on-site staff. In addition, we knew we needed to design our courses so they can be deployed in multiple contexts, including domestic face-to-face and distance as well as multiple international sites.

We met all of these demands by focusing on a development process enabled by open source git software, which provided a collaborative authoring environment and robust version control and resulted in the course being constructed from a series of text files in Markdown format. Significant efficiencies were attained through avoiding proprietary authoring environments. Having the final course files in a flexible and modular format allows us to deploy courses to multiple web environments and to build localized logistics and course instructions around the core content repository.

In this interactive demonstration, we will show how we used open source software and the principles of open design to gain significant efficiencies from the perspectives of a remote instructional designer, on-site subject matter experts, and an educational technologist.

This presentation aligns with at least three of the themes identified in the Call for Proposals:

* Emerging Pedagogies and Designs for Online Learning
* Expanding Access, Openness and Flexibility
* New Delivery Tools and Resources for Learning
